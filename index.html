3 Ways to Stop Your Worst Money Leaks</h1>

<p class="bodytext">If you're finding it hard to reach your savings goals, even after some smart budgeting, you could be suffering from money leakage. Like a drippy pipe in your basement, money leaks might not seem like a big deal today. But over time, that steady drip, drip, drip can add up. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Fortunately—unlike that drippy pipe—fixing money leaks just takes a little awareness and a few simple tools. You don’t even have to call a plumber.</p>
<h2 class="subhead" style="clear:both">1. Analyze Your Spending (But Skip the Spreadsheets)</h2>
<p class="bodytext">You probably have at least a rough idea of how much you spend on gas, restaurants, entertainment, etc. And if you’re really on the ball, you might even have a carefully planned budget for each category. That’s a great start. But what if you knew exactly how much you were spending on fast food vs. family dinners out, or those incidental Amazon purchases vs. Target runs? That’s where Mint comes in.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a href="https://www.mint.com/">Mint</a> is a website/app that tracks your spending by connecting to your checking account(s), credit cards,  bills, loans, and even mortgage payments in one system. And it’s free. It’s like a financial control center, showing you how spending habits come together to produce your personal bottom line—all without opening up a spreadsheet.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a href="https://www.mint.com/">Mint</a> has features for many aspects of managing personal finances, but helping seal up those money leaks is where it really shines.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Some of <a href="https://www.mint.com/">Mint's</a> key features:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="bullets" style="clear:both">Sorts purchases automatically into useful categories and tracks your spending in each</li>
  <li class="bullets">Suggests budgets based on your spending habits and national averages</li>
  <li class="bullets">Notifies you when your spending is in danger of going over budget</li>
  <li class="bullets">Creates graphs of long-term trends in your spending</li>
</ul>

<p class="bodytext">With the kind of control and information <a href="https://www.mint.com/">Mint</a> provides, it’s much easier to see where your money is really going and when.</p>
<p class="bodytext">I use the app myself, and it has popped up notifications on my phone to warn me when I'm dipping too far into my budget too early in the month. It's especially great for weekends when you're more focused on enjoying your day than crunching numbers. I've been saved from going overboard quite few times that way. Those little reminders  at key moments  have been invaluable in changing my money-leaking ways.</p>
<h2 class="subhead">2. Avoid Surprise Fees</h2>
<p class="bodytext">When it comes to fees, the last thing they should be is hidden. Whether it&rsquo;s your internet service, your bank, or your cellphone provider, there&rsquo;s nothing more annoying (or shady) than getting hit with fees you weren&rsquo;t told about and didn&rsquo;t notice until you&rsquo;d already been paying them for months.</p>

<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">For those of us who don&rsquo;t have time to pore over every single line item of every bill each month, it&rsquo;s good practice to check in every three months on bills that might have jumped up a few dollars here and there. Better to catch those charges before they have time to rack up into the hundreds. Try setting recurring calendar reminders on your phone (a life-saver for me) or putting a note on your paper calendar every three months.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Introductory Rates</h3>
<p class="bullets"><span class="bodytext">If you've recently signed up for a new cable or internet service, chances are you got a special &quot;introductory rate.&quot; Make a  note in your calendar of the period's end date. When the day approaches, pick up the phone and give your provider a call. Often, just the act of calling and saying you're not happy with the new price will be enough to get a rate reduction. If you're really serious, threatening to cancel is also an option. Just make sure there's another provider in your area in the rare event that they call your bluff. In that case, it might be time to move on to a new company's introductory rate.</span></p>
<h3 class="subhead">Modem Rental</h3>
<p class="bullets">While we're on the subject of internet providers, let's talk modem rental. Most providers will try to rent you their proprietary modem when you first sign up for service, usually at around $8/month. You can shave that cost off your bill with a quick Google search for a compatible modem. The up-front cost will be a bit higher (usually around $70) but the modem will more than pay for itself by the end of the year.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Bank Fees</h3>
<p class="bodytext">If you&rsquo;re going through a tight time like a job transition, recent graduation, or major purchase, many banks are ready to ding your checking account with fees if your balance drops even a penny below their required minimum (which can be as high as $1,500 at some major banks—yikes).</p>
<p class="bodytext">But paying high monthly fees isn&rsquo;t a requirement for having a checking account these days, especially if you&rsquo;re with a credit union rather than a big bank. With Tulsa FCU&rsquo;s Advanced Checking account, for instance, you&rsquo;ll pay no fees as long as you keep at least $100 in your account, and you&rsquo;ll even earn interest on your balance each month. A checking account with an interest rate is the opposite of a money leak—and that adds up.</p>
<h2 class="subhead">3. Save on Meals</h2>
<p class="bodytext">If you&rsquo;re like many people (myself very much included), you eat out a little more often than you should. Mint has informed me that my lunch runs on  weekdays really have to stop if I want to get serious about saving. Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a better way: <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mealprepsunday&amp;src=tyah">#MealPrepSunday.</a></p>

<p class="bodytext">Here are the basics:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="bullets">Pick a few <a href="http://imgur.com/a/RNZzq">simple recipes</a>—soups, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itjjOydIgKk&amp;feature=youtu.be">breakfast burritos</a>, and <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/robertbroadfoot/step-up-your-meal-prep-game?utm_term=.dbwejM7l#.uq0GdMW7">easy meat and greens dishes</a> work particularly well</li>
  <li class="bullets">Shop for ingredients during the week</li>
  <li class="bullets">Come Sunday afternoon, make the dishes in big batches</li>
  <li class="bullets">Portion each one out into <a href="http://thesweethome.com/reviews/best-food-storage-containers/">reusable containers</a> to be refrigerated or frozen as desired</li>
  <li class="bullets">Boom, you&rsquo;ve got your lunches for the week—for as low as $2 per meal</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullets">What really sets meal prep apart from last night's leftovers is the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/mealprepsunday/?hl=en">online community of trailblazers</a> who have found the easiest and best recipes and written up instructions specifically for other &ldquo;preppers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="bullets">For example, my personal tip on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itjjOydIgKk&amp;feature=youtu.be">breakfast burritos</a> is to let your scrambled eggs cool off completely before rolling into the tortilla—it keeps the moisture down and means the resulting burrito will come out crisp and delicious in the microwave rather than soft and slimy. If you&rsquo;re already a prepper yourself, feel free to drop your favorite recipes and tips in the comments. I&rsquo;m always looking for ideas!</p>
